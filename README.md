Toolbox for structural analysis of proteins.

**WIP** EVERYTHING IS UNDER DEELOPMENT!

Many features are still not commented/documented or even mentioned. Feel free to explore and/or use any functions.

Can be downloaded from the [test PiPy repository](https://test.pypi.org/) but note the used version as any function might change during development.


_INFO_

Relevant python code can be found in the `src` folder within their relevant folders.

Preset workflows are being developend, including the [projectDimer](Https://GitHub.com/Thecnopapa/projectDimer) workflow. (WIP)

*Biopython*
Works with wrappers of the main Biopython classes. Adding functionality without loosing their original value 

Includes general-purpose tools and pipelines for importing, processing, and exporting structures.

*Symmetries*
Also contains crystallographic data processing tools. Such as those for dealing with symmetries. (WIP)

*Tools*
A reworked Biopython.DSSP module is also included, as well as a PISA wrapper (WIP)

*Utilities*
Additionally, a large set of utilities is included, from logging, to common mathematical operations.

*Visualization*
For structural visualisation, a custom PyMol scripting framework is included, replacing heavy sessions with generative commands. (WIP)
