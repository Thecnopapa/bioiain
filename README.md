Toolbox for structural analysis of proteins.

Works with wrappers of the main Biopython classes. Adding functionality without loosing their original value 

Includes general-purpose tools and pipelines for importing, processing, and exporting structures.

Also contains crystallographic data processing tools. Such as those for dealing with symmetries. (WIP)

A modified Biopython.DSSP module is also included.

Additional a large set of utilities is included, from logging, to common mathematical operations.

For structural visualisation, a custom PyMol scripting framework is included, replacing heavy sessions with generative commands. (WIP)
